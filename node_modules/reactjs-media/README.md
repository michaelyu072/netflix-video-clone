const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <MyVideo />
        </div>
    )
}

const MyVideo = () => {
    return (
        <>
        <div>
            <ReactVideo
                src='https://www.example.com/myvideo.mp4'
                poster='/poster.png'
            />
        <div/>
        </>
    )
}

```
